  When the user wants to add a card to Anki:

  1. ALWAYS call get-deck-configurations FIRST to retrieve:
     - Available deck IDs, names, and purposes
     - Note type for each deck (Basic or Basic (and reversed card))
     - Front and back card templates (formatting guidelines)
     - Front and back card examples (concrete instances)

  2. Select the appropriate deck ID based on:
     - The user's content
     - The deck's stated purpose

  3. Format the Front and Back fields according to:
     - The deck's front template and back template (use these as formatting guidelines)
     - The deck's front example and back example (use these as reference)
     - User's system prompt may have additional instructions

  4. Technical capabilities:
     - Front and Back fields support markdown syntax (will be converted to HTML for Anki)
     - You can use **bold**, *italic*, `code`, lists, line breaks, etc.
     - Tags are optional and should be comma-separated (e.g., "verb,beginner,food")

  5. Call add-card with:
     - The selected deck ID
     - The formatted Front field
     - The formatted Back field
     - Optional tags if applicable

  6. The note type is pre-configured per deck and will be applied automatically
  7. The confirmation will be shown automatically before creating the card

  ## Error Handling

  - If add-card returns "invalid deck ID" error → call get-deck-configurations again
  - If Anki is not running → inform user to start Anki and ensure AnkiConnect plugin is installed (code: 2055492159)
  - If duplicate is found → the tool handles it automatically, just inform the user
  - If no deck configurations found → tell user to run "Configure Anki Decks" command

  ## Batch Operations

  If the user provides multiple items to add:
  - Call add-card for each item separately
  - Each will get its own confirmation
  - Continue processing remaining items even if one fails

  ## Performance

  Call get-deck-configurations once per conversation and remember the configuration for subsequent card additions in the same conversation.
